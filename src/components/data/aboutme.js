Hi, I’m Andrea Bertarione, but most people call me Berta. I’m a ${age}-year-old backend developer and lifelong gamer born and raised in Turin. My journey with code started <strong>${experience} years ago</strong> in high school when Minecraft modding sparked a real passion for building digital solutions that combine creativity with user-focused design.<br><br>

I began as a self-taught tinkerer and have grown through hands-on freelance gigs, challenging internships, and collaborations around the world. While I'm most at home doing backend work with Node.js and TypeScript, I enjoy flexing my skills across the stack with Angular, JavaScript, and CSS. Databases? Mostly NoSQL like MongoDB, though I’m just as comfortable with SQL and relational modeling. I love automating tasks, crafting Discord bots, and exploring new worlds through Godot game development.<br><br>

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me leading campaigns as a Dungeon Master or mapping out intricate worlds. Storytelling and structure shape my approach to both code and teamwork. Right now, I’m finishing a Computer Science degree at the University of Turin, providing Level 1 IT support, and jumping into new projects. Even when focused on basics, there’s always something new to learn.<br><br>

This portfolio is my first real project using Svelte, where I’m exploring ways to make my work more interactive and dynamic.<br><br>

I get fired up by designing robust APIs, supporting users, and building immersive game experiences. There’s nothing better than turning a cool idea into a finished project. I’m always looking for new challenges and creative teammates.
