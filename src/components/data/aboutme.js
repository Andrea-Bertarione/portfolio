Hi, I’m Andrea Bertarione—also known as Berta—a ${age}-year-old backend developer and lifelong gamer based in Turin.<br> I began programming <strong>${experience} years ago</strong>, starting with Minecraft modding in high school, and quickly found a passion for building digital solutions that blend code, creativity, and user-centered design.<br><br>

Over the years, I’ve grown from a self-taught enthusiast into a developer with hands-on experience across freelance projects, internships, and international tech collaborations.<br> My main focus is backend development with Node.js and TypeScript, but I’m also comfortable working across the stack with Angular, pure JavaScript, and CSS. I primarily use NoSQL databases like MongoDB, but I’m also well-versed in SQL and relational data modeling.<br> I enjoy automating workflows, building Discord bots, and experimenting with game development in Godot.<br><br>

As a Dungeon Master and world-builder, I bring storytelling and structure to both my code and my collaborations.<br> I’m currently completing my Computer Science degree at the University of Turin, while providing Level 1 IT support and contributing to a range of projects—sometimes just scratching the surface, but always learning something new.<br><br>

Right now, I’m building this portfolio as my first real project with Svelte, exploring new ways to make my work both interactive and efficient.<br><br>

Whether it’s designing robust APIs, supporting users, or crafting immersive game experiences, I love turning ideas into reality—and I’m always eager for new challenges and collaborations.
